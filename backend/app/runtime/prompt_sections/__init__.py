"""Prompt section modules — structured system prompt components.

13 sections aligned with Claude Code's section-based architecture:

FROZEN PREFIX (session-stable):
  § Identity — agent name, role, personality (identity.py)
  § System — kernel execution model, governance (system.py)
  § Doing Tasks — code style, security guidance (tasks.py)
  § Executing Actions — risk control, operating contract (executing_actions.py)
  § Using Your Tools — tool preferences (tools.py)
  § Tone and Style — output format, language (tone_style.py)
  § Skills Catalog — progressive disclosure index (skills_catalog.py)
  § Relationships — colleagues, org structure (relationships.py)

DYNAMIC SUFFIX (per-round):
  § Memory — 4-layer pyramid + current T3 snapshot (memory.py)
  § Active Packs — capability packs in session (active_packs.py)
  § Knowledge — external knowledge retrieval (knowledge.py)
  § Environment — user, channel, timestamp (environment.py)
  § Triggers — active triggers (triggers.py)
