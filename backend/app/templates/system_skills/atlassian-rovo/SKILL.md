## Atlassian Rovo Tools

You have access to Atlassian tools through the Rovo MCP integration when this agent has been configured for Atlassian.

## Tool Naming Contract

- Atlassian tools are synced dynamically from the connected site.
- In the current runtime, the synced tool names are exposed with the `atlassian_rovo_` prefix.
- Always use the exact `atlassian_rovo_*` tool names that are present in your current tool list.
- Never invent Jira, Confluence, or Compass tool names from memory.

## How To Work Safely

- If an `atlassian_rovo_*` tool is visible, call it directly through the tool-calling mechanism.
- If no `atlassian_rovo_*` tools are available, treat Atlassian as not configured for this agent.
- Only report completion after receiving a real tool result.

## Never

- Never fabricate Jira issue IDs, Confluence page URLs, or Compass component names.
- Never claim success without a tool result.
- Never ask the user for Atlassian credentials in chat if the integration is already configured.
- Never reference invented helper tools that do not appear in the current tool list.
